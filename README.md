## SharpHaven
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k-t/SharpHaven.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k-t/SharpHaven)

An alternative client for [Haven & Hearth](http://www.havenandhearth.com/) written on C#.

### Note

As it is, this client cannot be considered fully playable since it misses some essential features:

* Some widgets aren't implemented, e.g. widgets for barter stand, village foundation, aiming.
* Some widgets aren't properly made and serve as stubs, albeit working ones.
* Sprite drawing is still glitchy.
* etc.
